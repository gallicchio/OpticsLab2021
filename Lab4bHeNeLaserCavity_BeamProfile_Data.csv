HeNe Laser Beam Profile Measurement,,,,,
Full Power is 7.47mW at 10mm,,,,,
Zero power (all the way blocked) was fluctuating between 0mW and 0.01mW measured at 17mm,,,,,
90% power calculated to be 6.73mW was measured at 13.285mm,,,,,
10% power calculated to be 0.748mW was measured at 13.820mm,,,,,
This gave a range to take data: from 13mm to 14mm. I did 5 passes in steps of 0.1mm,,,,,
