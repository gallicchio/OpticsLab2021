%\begin{problem}[Steck 8.1 (3\,pts)]
%	Write down the Jones matrix for an ideal polarizer that transmits $x$-polarized light. A realistic polarizer
%	along the $x$-direction blocks some fraction $\alpha$ (of the \textit{electric field}) of the $x$ polarization, and transmits some fraction $\beta$ of the $y$ polarization. (Both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ should be small for a decent polarizer.) Write down the Jones matrix for this realistic polarizer.

\begin{problem}[Steck 8.2 (5\,pts)]
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[(a)] Consider a linear polarizer and a wave linearly polarized at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the polarizer's transmission axis. Show that the intensity of the wave is reduced by $\cos^2 \theta$ after passing through the polarizer (this is called the \textbf{Law of Malus}). [Hint: Use the rotation matrix and its inverse.]
		\item[(b)] Consider a system of $N$ cascaded polarizers. The polarizers have their transmission axes at angles $\pi/2N, 2\pi/2N, 3\pi/2N, \cdots \pi/2$ from the $x$-axis, in the order that an input wave sees them. That is, the last polarizer is oriented along the $y$-direction. Suppose that an input wave is polarized in the $x$-direction. Compute the intensity transmission coefficient for the system. Show that the transmission coefficient approaches unity as $N \rightarrow \infty$. This is a simple realization of the \textbf{quantum Zeno effect}, where each polarizer acts as a ``measurement'' of the polarization stateâ€”the polarization is ``dragged'' by the measurements as long as they are sufficiently frequent.

\begin{problem}[Arbitrary Waveplate Jones Matrices (10\,pts)]
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[(a)] Write the Jones Matrix for an arbitrary wave plate, which adds a phase $\eta$ in the y-direction relative to the x-direction.
		\item[(b)] Find the Jones Matrix for such a waveplate when it's oriented at some angle $\theta$. [For this and what follows, something like Mathematica is helpful. And don't worry about the sign of $\theta$ that I worried about in my lecture---everything here is even in $\theta$.]
		\item[(c)] If horizontally-polarized light passes through this waveplate and then thorugh a horizontal polarizer, what fraction of intensity makes it through as a function of $\theta$ and $\eta$?
		\item[(d)] Simplify this fraction as a function of $\theta$ for a half-waveplate and a quarter-waveplate.
		\item[(e)] Plot this fraction as a function of $\theta$ for three different cases on the same plot (with a  legend): half-waveplate, quarter-waveplate, and eighth-waveplate.

\begin{problem}[Fitting Waveplate Data (10\,pts)]
	Watch the video \texttt{Lab5Polarization.mp4}. I wasn't careful enough with the polarizer and HWP data, and the motorized data at the end had some strange features, so I'll only ask you to analyze the quarter-waveplate data. The others would have been boringly similar. \\
	
	Download \texttt{QWP.csv}. Briefly look at the file in a text editor or spreadsheet program. Fit the data to the function you found in the previous problem for the arbitrary waveplate. You'll need 3 parameters:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the overall amplitude (the meter reads in mW, not fraction transmitted),
		\item the angular offset of the waveplate in the mount (a few degrees plus or minus---by convention, this parameter is meant to be the reading on the dial that sets the actual wave-plate to true zero degrees), and
		\item the fractional retardance (should be close to 0.25 because it would be a quarter waveplate if the wavelength of the laser diode exactly matched the wavelength that the waveplate was designed for, which is almost never perfectly the case).
	\end{itemize}
	Be sure to supply reasonable, non-zero initial guesses for these parameters because this is a non-linear fit. \\
	
	Be sure to calculate the reduced $\chi^2$ and PTE.
